# Ext.ux.Deferred

Ext.ux.Deferred provides promises for ExtJS and Sencha Touch.

It allows to manage async functions with ease.

## Problems
The first problem is with the [**Pyramid of Doom**](http://tritarget.org/blog/2012/11/28/the-pyramid-of-doom-a-javascript-style-trap/), namely nested asynchronous functions, like this:

```javascript
aSync1 (10, function (val1) {
	aSync2 (val1, function (val2) {
		aSync3 (val2, function (val3) {
			alert ('Top of the pyramid with: ', val3);
		});
	});
});
```

What we want here is to have a comfortable way to chain those asynchronous functions. With `Ext.ux.Deferred` it will be rewritten as follows:

```javascript
aSync1 (10)
	.then (aSync2)
	.then (aSync3)
	.then (function (val3) {
		alert ('End of the queue with: ', val3);
	});
```

Each result is given as an argument to the next async function on the chain path.

The second problem is make a function start after the execution of a set of asynchronous functions.
Take the above functions as example: now, we want to start the last anonymous function at the end of their execution: `Ext.ux.Deferred` has a static method, called when, that allows you to do that! Get the following example:

```javascript
Ext.ux.Deferred
	.when (aSync1, aSync2, aSync3)
	.then (function (val3) {
		alert ('End of everything with: ', val3);
	});
```

## Tutorial
`Ext.ux.Deferred` can be used to defer asynchronous processes.
The first thing to do is to make a new deferred:

```javascript
function aSync1 (val) {
	var dfd = Ext.create ('Ext.ux.Deferred') ,
		task = setInterval (function () {
			// here your async task
			clearInterval (task);
		}, 1000);
		
	return dfd;
}
```

Then, use the resolve/reject method to tell your promise what to do:

```javascript
function aSync1 (val) {
	var dfd = Ext.create ('Ext.ux.Deferred') ,
		task = setInterval (function () {
			if (ipoteticalCounter > IPOTETICAL_VALUE) dfd.resolve (data);
			else dfd.reject (data);
			
			clearInterval (task);
		}, 1000);
	
	return dfd;
}
```

Now, you are ready to use your deferred by handling the result!
The first method, *then*, accepts two args: the first one is the success callback, while the second one is the fail callback:

```javascript
var promise = aSync1(10);

promise.then (
	function (result) {
		alert ('The promise has been solved with: ', result);
	} ,
	function (result) {
		alert ('The promise has been rejected with: ', result);
	}
);
```

Otherwise, it can be used the done-fail approach:

```javascript
var promise = aSync1(10);

promise
	.done (function (result) {
		alert ('The promise has been solved with: ', result);
	})
	.fail (function (result) {
		alert ('The promise has been rejected with: ', result);
	});
```

Or the *always* method, invoked in every situation (both success and fail):

```javascript
var promise = aSync1(10);

promise.always (function (result) {
	alert ('The promise has been solved or rejected with: ', result);
});
```

## Usage
Load `Ext.ux.Deferred` via `Ext.require`:

```javascript
Ext.Loader.setConfig ({
	enabled: true
});

Ext.require (['Ext.ux.Deferred']);
```

Now, you are ready to use them in your code as follows:

```javascript
var dfd = Ext.create ('Ext.ux.Deferred') ,
	task = setInterval (function () {
		deferred.resolve (10);
		clearInterval (task);
	}, 1000);

Ext.ux.Deferred
	.when (dfd)
	.then (function (value) {
		alert (value); // will print 10
	});
```

## Documentation
You can build the documentation (like ExtJS Docs) with [**jsduck**](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck):

```bash
$ jsduck ux --output /var/www/docs
```

It will make the documentation into docs dir and it will be visible at: http://localhost/docs
